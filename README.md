# MovieRecommenderSystem
This is a ML based Movie Recommender system that uses content-based filtering to recommend movies.

This Website is built over Streamlit framework and uses simplistic UI to recommend top 5 most similar movies to the movie given as input by the user.
The recommendation is based on content-based filtering recommendation technique.

After choosing the movie from dropdown, when user clicks on Recommend button, the recommender system model kicks in and process the input movie and returns back 5 most similar movies based on Movies's Cast, Crew, Director, Genre, etc.

P.S. Recommendation might take a couple of seconds as filtering used in project has no external fast libraries used and is manually implemented and uses text vectorization of more than 5000 movies.
